## Key Highlights

- **Beta Calculation:**  
  Estimated beta of **1.288** using 5 years of monthly returns vs. S&P 500  
  Implies Netflix stock moves slightly more than the market on average

- **Cost of Equity:**  
  Derived using CAPM with a market risk premium of 4.75% →  
  **Cost of Equity = 9.81%**

- **Unlevered Beta:**  
  Adjusted for capital structure → **1.021**, indicating lower systematic risk without debt

- **Capital Structure:**  
  Netflix’s debt-to-asset ratio dropped from **71.8% in 2020** to **57.2% in 2022**, signaling a strategic shift toward a more equity-financed structure

- **EPS Growth:**  
  Basic EPS nearly **doubled** from $6.26 (2020) to $10.10 (2022), showing strong value creation

## Leverage & Risk Analysis

- **Leverage Comparison** with Disney, Warner Bros, Amazon, and Apple shows that Netflix has a moderate leverage ratio (**29.5%**) — slightly below the industry average
- **Credit Ratings:** S&P: BBB / Moody’s: Ba1 (with positive outlook)
- **Default Risk:** Despite rising competition, strong earnings and liquidity reduce near-term risk

---

## Investment Perspective

- **Equity Investor:** High growth potential but moderate risk (Beta > 1)
- **Debt Investor:** Improving solvency and conservative leverage offer reassurance
- **Valuation Outlook:** Near optimal capital structure, backed by strong EPS growth and industry leadership

- Applied regression and decomposition techniques to real market and company data
- Understood the interplay between market conditions, leverage, and investment risk

---

## What I Plan to Improve
