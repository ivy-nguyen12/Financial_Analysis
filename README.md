# Netflix Financial Analysis

This project is a comprehensive financial analysis of Netflix Inc., conducted as part of a Corporate Financial Reporting course. It evaluates the company’s capital structure, performance, and risk profile through the lens of financial statements, ratio analysis, and valuation models.

**Prepared by:** Vy Nguyen (as part of the MBA in Finance program)

## Project Overview

- **Company Analyzed:** Netflix Inc.
- **Time Frame:** Fiscal Years 2020–2022
- **Objective:** Assess Netflix’s financial performance, leverage strategy, capital structure, and investment risk from both equity and debt perspectives.

---

## Tools & Methods

- **Data Sources:** Netflix's 10-K financial reports, Yahoo Finance, S&P 500 index data
- **Methods Applied:**
  - Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate the required return and cost of equity
  - Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to estimate intrinsic value using projected free cash flows and WACC
  - Beta and Unlevered Beta estimation
  - Ratio analysis (liquidity, efficiency, profitability, solvency)
  - DuPont decomposition
  - Peer leverage benchmarking
  - Cash flow trend analysis (operating, investing, financing)
  - Earnings quality and risk assessment

## Valuation Insights

| Model | Assumptions | Estimated Price |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| CAPM  | Risk-free rate: 3.69%, Market return: 8.44%, Beta: 1.27 | 9.81% required return |
| DCF   | 5-year cash flow projection, WACC ≈ 9.8%, Terminal growth: 2.5% | ~$450 intrinsic value |

- CAPM was used to derive Netflix’s cost of equity, which served as an input for the DCF model.
- DCF valuation suggests that Netflix was modestly undervalued at the time of analysis (intrinsic value ~$450 vs. market price ~$400 in late 2023).

## Key Ratios and Trends (2020–2022)

| Metric                 | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |
|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Return on Assets (ROA) | 4.3%   | 6.7%   | 10.8%  |
| Return on Equity (ROE) | 17.5%  | 22.3%  | 24.5%  |
| EPS ($)                | 6.26   | 8.19   | 10.10  |
| Debt-to-Equity Ratio   | 2.54   | 1.85   | 1.34   |
| Beta (5Y Monthly)      | 1.28   | 1.12   | 0.92   |

## Leverage & Risk Analysis

- Netflix’s leverage ratio (29.5%) was slightly below the industry average based on comparisons with Disney, Warner Bros., Amazon, and Apple.
- Credit Ratings: S&P: BBB / Moody’s: Ba1 (with positive outlook)
- Despite increasing competition, Netflix’s strong earnings, declining beta, and healthy liquidity lowered short-term default risk.

---

## Key Findings

- Netflix’s ROA and ROE improved steadily, signaling enhanced operational efficiency and profitability.
- EPS increased from $6.26 in 2020 to $10.10 in 2022, reflecting robust earnings growth.
- Debt-to-equity ratio declined significantly, indicating reduced financial risk and improved capital structure.
- Beta declined over time, suggesting reduced stock volatility and a more stable risk profile.
- The DCF model estimated Netflix's intrinsic value at ~$450, suggesting it was slightly undervalued in late 2023.

---

## Investment Perspective

- **Equity Investor:** High growth potential with a moderate risk profile (Beta > 1 earlier, but declining)
- **Debt Investor:** Improving solvency and a more conservative capital structure enhance credit quality
- **Valuation Outlook:** Near optimal leverage and strong EPS growth, with the stock appearing modestly undervalued based on DCF analysis

## What I Learned

- CAPM and DCF models together provide a robust framework for assessing cost of capital and intrinsic value.
- DCF modeling is more appropriate than dividend models for firms like Netflix that reinvest earnings.
- Multi-year trend and ratio analysis are essential for understanding a company’s financial trajectory and investment potential.

---

## What I Plan to Improve

- Add peer-based valuation using relative multiples (e.g., EV/EBITDA, P/E) for triangulation
- Integrate updated market and macroeconomic data to refine risk-return assumptions
- Explore scenario and sensitivity analysis to assess valuation impact under different growth and discount rate assumptions
