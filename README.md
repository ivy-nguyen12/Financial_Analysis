- **Methods Applied:**
  - Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate required return and cost of equity

## Valuation Insights

| Model | Assumptions | Estimated Price |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| CAPM  | Risk-free rate: 2.8%, Market return: 10%, Beta: 0.92 | 10.56% required return |
| GGM   | Dividend per share: $2.05, Growth: 3% | $29.29 fair value |

- CAPM showed declining beta, indicating reduced volatility.
- GGM indicated that Netflix was undervalued at the time of the analysis.

## Leverage & Risk Analysis

- **Leverage Comparison** with Disney, Warner Bros, Amazon, and Apple shows that Netflix has a moderate leverage ratio (**29.5%**) — slightly below the industry average
- **Credit Ratings:** S&P: BBB / Moody’s: Ba1 (with positive outlook)
- **Default Risk:** Despite rising competition, strong earnings and liquidity reduce near-term risk

---

## Key Findings

- Netflix’s **ROA and ROE improved year over year**, showing increasing operational efficiency and return on equity investment.
- **Earnings per share (EPS)** showed strong growth from $6.26 in 2020 to $10.10 in 2022.
- The **Debt-to-Equity ratio decreased** from 2.54 to 1.34, reflecting improved capital structure and lower financial risk.
- **Netflix's valuation** using GGM suggested that the stock might be undervalued, despite market headwinds in 2022.
- **Beta declined**, implying a shift in stock risk profile to be closer to the market average.

## Investment Perspective

- **Equity Investor:** High growth potential but moderate risk (Beta > 1)
- **Debt Investor:** Improving solvency and conservative leverage offer reassurance
- **Valuation Outlook:** Near optimal capital structure, backed by strong EPS growth and industry leadership

## What I Learned

- Applying real-world valuation models like CAPM and GGM enhances interpretation of financial risk and investor return expectations.
- Financial trend analysis offers powerful insights into business performance beyond single-period analysis.
- Financial statements and ratio interpretation are foundational for understanding business strategy and investor outcomes.

---

## What I Plan to Improve

- Expand the analysis with discounted cash flow (DCF) modeling to complement dividend-based valuation.
- Add scenario analysis based on different macroeconomic or strategic growth assumptions.
- Include peer benchmarking (e.g., Disney+, Amazon Prime) to contextualize Netflix’s performance.
